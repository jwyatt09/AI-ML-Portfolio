# AI-ML-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of the different projects I completed during my post grad program with the University of Texas at Austin for AI/Machine Learning
with Business Applications.

Each project showcases different skills that we covered during the course. This is not a full list of all skills and techniques learned or used in each
project but I wanted to try and highlight the key new skills that I learned and applied with each new project.

Project 1 - Cardio_Good_Fitness: Data Visualization for Univariate and Bivariate analysis using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

Project 2 - Cars4U: Multivariate analysis, feature engineering, outlier treatment, Linear Regression Modeling, and Sequential Feature Selector

Project 3 - Personal_Loan_Campaign: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Feature Importance, and Hyperparameter Tuning with GridsearchCV

Project 4 - Tourism_Package: Ensemble Techniques such as Random Forest, Bagging, Ada Boost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, and Stacking classifiers

Project 5 - Credit_Churn_Prediction: Class Balancing, SMOTE, Random Under and Over Sampling, Near Miss, Cross Validation, and Randomized Search CV

Project 6 - AllLife_Bank_Customer_Segmentation: Scaling, Clustering, Elbow Method, Silhouette Visualizer, 
            Hierarchial Clustering with different distance metrics, Dendrograms, and Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

Project 7 - Bank_Churn: Artificial Neural Networks, Tensor Flow, Keras, Dense layers, Dropout, binary-crossentropy, activation functions, 
            kernel intializers, optimizers, Batch Normalization, and Classification Report
            
Project 8 - Plant_Seedling_Classification: Computer Vision, OpenCV, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Early Stopping, Model Checkpoint, VGG16, 
            Label Binarizer, Gaussian Blur, BGR to RGB conversion, Data Augmentation with Image Data Generator, Softmax activation,
            and categorical-crossentropy
            
Project 9 - NLP_Twitter_US_Airline_Sentiment: Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, Word Clouds, Stop words, Word Tokenization, 
            Word Net Lemmatizer, Beautiful Soup, Count Vectorization (Bag of Words), and Tf-IDF Vectorization
